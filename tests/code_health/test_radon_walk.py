"""The complexity walk, against radon's real output shape.

These fixtures are trimmed copies of genuine ``radon cc -j`` output, not
invented ones, because the whole point is that radon's shape is surprising:
methods appear twice, class blocks carry a derived aggregate, and
``--show-closures`` promotes closures while also leaving them nested.
