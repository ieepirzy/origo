"""Canonical normalized code-health snapshot: version, shape, validation.

The snapshot -- not an OTEL metric, not a row in someone's TSDB -- is the
source representation.  Everything else is derived from it.  That makes the
rules here load-bearing for a dataset meant to stay interpretable for years:

* ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` bumps whenever the *meaning* of an existing field
  changes.  Adding a new optional field does not require a bump; redefining
  ``complexity.aggregate`` does.
* Missing is not zero.  A metric that was not measured, or whose analyzer
  failed, is ``None`` -- never ``0``.  Every analyzer-backed section carries
  its own :data:`STATUSES` value so a reader can tell the two apart without
  guessing.
* Denominators and thresholds that a derived metric depends on are written
  into the artifact (``definitions``) rather than living only in prose, so a
  future analyst can interpret an old snapshot without this repository.
