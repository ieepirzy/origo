"""Ruff adapter.

Two facts about ruff's JSON output shape this adapter:

* ``ruff check`` exits 1 when it finds violations and 2 on an internal error
  (bad config, unparseable file).  Conflating them would turn "ruff could not
  run" into "ruff found nothing", so exit 2 is an ``error`` while exit 1 is a
  perfectly ``ok`` run that happens to have findings.
* ruff has no notion of "warning" vs "error" severity.  Rather than invent
  one, findings are split on whether the rule is in the repository's
  *blocking* selection: those are ``errors``, the rest are ``warnings``.  The
  split rule is recorded in the snapshot so the number stays interpretable.

The rule selection is always passed explicitly, never left to ruff's defaults.
That is not a style preference; it is what makes ``lint.total`` a metric at all.

Caught in CI on the first run of this lane: the same commit measured 12
findings locally under ruff 0.15.8 and 153 under ruff 0.16.4, because 0.16
widened its default selection to include UP, I, RUF, BLE, SIM and TRY -- and
simultaneously dropped E402 from the defaults, so the *blocking* count moved
12 -> 10 as well.  An unpinned dependency float had silently redefined the
metric by a factor of twelve and quietly changed which findings gate the build.

With ``--select`` passed explicitly the same two versions agree exactly (13
findings, 12 of them blocking, on this repository).  The selection travels in
``lint.select`` so a future change to it is visible in the data rather than
inferred, and ``deltas`` marks a comparison across such a change incomparable.
