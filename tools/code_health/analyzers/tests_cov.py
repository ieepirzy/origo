"""Test-result and coverage adapter.

Reads machine-readable reports rather than scraping console output: a JUnit XML
file for test outcomes and a ``coverage.py`` XML or JSON report for coverage.
Both are optional and independently missing-able -- a repository with tests but
no coverage instrumentation yields real test counts and a ``None`` coverage,
which is the honest representation and not ``0.0``.

This adapter deliberately does not *run* the test suite.  CI already runs it,
usually inside a container or a matrix; re-running it here would double the
cost and could disagree with the run that actually gates the build.  The
collector consumes the artifacts that run produced.
