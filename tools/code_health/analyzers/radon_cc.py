"""Radon adapters: cyclomatic complexity, raw LOC, maintainability, Halstead.

The complexity walk here carries the one non-obvious correctness rule in the
whole collector, so it is stated once, precisely.

``radon cc -j`` returns, per file, a *flat* list of blocks containing class,
function and method blocks.  Each method appears twice -- once at top level and
once nested under its class's ``methods`` key -- and each class block carries a
complexity *derived from* its methods rather than measured independently.
Summing the flat list therefore counts every method roughly twice.  Closures
are the mirror-image trap: by default they appear only nested under
``closures``, so a top-level-only walk silently drops them.

``--show-closures`` is radon's own answer to the second half: it promotes each
closure to top level under a qualified name (``https_open.build_conn``) while
*also* leaving it nested.  So with the flag on, recursing into ``closures``
would reintroduce a double count from the other direction.  The flag is used
and the recursion is not, on the same principle that governs the rest of this
codebase: prefer the library's own API over hand-rolling equivalent behaviour.

Verified directly against this repository (``origo``, 24 files, radon 6.0.1):

* without the flag the flat list holds 100 blocks = 10 classes + 30 functions
  + 60 methods, and radon's own ``--total-average`` footer agrees ("100 blocks
  (classes, functions, methods)");
* the 60 top-level method entries are identical to the 60 nested under classes;
* the flag adds exactly the 2 closures that existed, as top-level qualified
  functions, and leaves them nested as well;
* naive sum over the flat list = 484 over 102 blocks; the correct
  function-level aggregate = 440 over 92 symbols.

So: take top-level ``function`` and ``method`` blocks with ``--show-closures``
on, and never count ``class``.
