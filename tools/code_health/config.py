"""Per-repository configuration.

A repository declares its own analysis target in a file it owns, rather than in
workflow YAML.  That is what lets the same collector run unchanged across
repositories: CI orchestrates, the repository configures, and neither contains
the data model.

Two sources, in precedence order:

``mira-vitals.toml``
    A standalone file with the settings at the top level.  For repositories
    with no ``pyproject.toml`` -- an application built around
    ``requirements.txt`` rather than a package, where adding a
    ``pyproject.toml`` purely to hold a few settings changes how build and
    packaging tools see the repository, which is a bigger change than it looks.
``pyproject.toml``
    ``[tool.tools.code_health]``, for repositories that already have one.

``code-health.toml`` and ``[tool.code_health]`` are also read, after those:
the first repositories to adopt this collector did so before it was extracted
into a package, and breaking them on rename would be a poor advertisement for a
tool whose entire pitch is not silently redefining things.
